Originally built as the mascot of Bon's Burgers, a family restaurant chain owned by Felix Kranken and Jack Walten, Bon became the vessel for something deeply wrong.\n\n== Appearance ==\nBon's design is that of a large anthropomorphic rabbit, predominantly white with black eyes and a wide, unsettling grin. The animatronic is capable of movement far beyond its normal parameters.\n\n== Role in the Series ==\nThroughout the series, Bon is shown pursuing employees and visitors to the abandoned restaurant. Its connection to the souls of the missing Walten family is heavily implied.\n\n== Reception ==\nBon is widely considered one of the most iconic figures in the analog horror genre.",
